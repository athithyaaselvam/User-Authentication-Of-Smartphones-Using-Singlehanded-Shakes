# User-Authentication-Of-Smartphones-Using-Singlehanded-Shakes
Dynamic Time Warping Approach

An immense amount of private information is stored in smartphones. In order to secure information from being tapped a new form of authentication mechanism is needed. Previous unlock mechanism like pattern authentication or code based authentication are vulnerable as they are not using a person's unique attribute. In this paper, we propose a method for unlocking phones based on userâ€™s handshakes. The gesture sensors and the proximity sensors help us capture the unique handshake of the person. This unlock mechanism makes it harder for the attacker to reproduce the same type of handshake even if he observes the shaking pattern.
